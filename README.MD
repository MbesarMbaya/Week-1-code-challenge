# Project Tittle: week 1 code challenge

## project Description
In this code challenge, I am going to work on the Grade Generator,speed detector and the Net Salary calculator by putting in knowledge obtained from the coursework of this week.

### challenge 1: Grade generator
I am writing a program that prompts the user to input student marks.The input should be between 0 and 100.Then output the correct grade as follows:
A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

### Challenge 2: Speed detector
In this challenge,I am writing a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80.If the speed is less than 70,it should print "OK".Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit(70),it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

### Challenge 3: Net salary calculator
In this challenge, I am writing a program that would calculate the Payee Tax,NHIF,NSSF deductions and net salary given the basic salary and benefits of an employee. KRA,NHIF,NSSF values are provided in these links: https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm , https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye
